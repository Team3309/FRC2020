Operator controller requests from Matthew 3/7/20:

Activate intake: single-tap left bumper
Activate outtake: single-tap right bumper
Cancel and retract intake: double-tap left or right bumper or press any D pad button, including D-down if not ready to shoot

Multi-ball shooting on left trigger
Scan on right trigger

D-down: stop flywheels, move arm to above intake position, retract intake (not when in a shooting mode)

hold A: emergency outtake when intake retracted (use lower power outtake to not impact shooting)

Back button: toggle climber deploy (not when in a shooting mode)

Start button: retract climber, stop winch, enable drive control (in case of accidental or missed deployment)

Winch only operates after climber has been deployed and retracted at least once
