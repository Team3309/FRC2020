There will be three pistons:
    One will retract the manipulator
    One will engage it
    And one will lift it an inch or so above the control panel such that the color sensor can still see the color

Requested behavior:
    Karson will press a button that will extend the manipulator into the raised, disengaged position
    He will drive up to the control panel
    When it has been reached, the drivetrain will stop and the manipulator will be engaged and lowered
    The required action will then be performed based on whether we have received a message from the FMS or not
